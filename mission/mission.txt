4 Aragami sighted in the Factory Ruins, \nidentified as <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> and <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)>. Make\nuse of the divided terrain to lure the <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> \naway from the immobile <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)> and defeat\nindividually.
Multiple <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> are gathering in the\nGrasslands. Eliminate the 4 in the area before\nthey pose a threat. Blaze, Freeze, and Spark\nattacks are all effective. Good luck.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> in the Factory Ruins.\nSpark is proven to be effective on this large\nbeast. <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> also confirmed in the area. \nAvoid conflict and bring down your target.
Confirmed multiple Aragami activity in the Old\nCity. Subdue 1 <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>\nthere. All attacks, except Divine, are effective\nagainst both species.
Received report of 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> invasion to the \nTemple Ruins, home to 3 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)>. Quickly \neliminate them all. Keep in mind, <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> has low \nSpark and Blaze resistance, but has keen hearing.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> invading the Grasslands. \nBeware of <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> in the area. They have an acute\nsense of vision and will call for nearby help if\nthey spot you. Take down only your target.
Aragami are herding in the Temple Ruins. Rush to\nthe scene and clear out the 3 <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>. They will \nalert others of your presence, so defeat them \nquickly. There seem to be <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> as well.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and 3 <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> in the Old City.\nPierce attacks to the leg slow <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> movement.\nCrush attacks to the face should deal a fatal\nblow. Avoid its air and ground tactics with\n<c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>.
3 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> are hiding at the Temple Ruins.\nThey're more intelligent, which explains why they\ncoexist with <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>. Don't get\noverwhelmed. Make sure to defeat them all.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>. Spark type weapons are \nrecommended. The battlefield will be at the open\ngrasslands, where <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> scatter the \narea. Expect maneuvering tactics within a limited\narea.
Defeat the rampaging <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> at the Subway \nRemains. They are very mobile, but are weak to\ndeep Freeze. Battle will take place in a narrow\nunderpass. Make sure to secure your escape route.
Tracking 2 <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> headed to the Outer Ghetto.\nRequesting Retaliation Squad to intercept them in\nthe Old Bay Area. <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> have keen hearing and\nskill at chain attacks. Note: Stun Grenade sound.
4 <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> confirmed, infiltrating the Temple\nRuins. Retaliation Squad requested to destroy all\ntargets. Beware of their visual alertness. There\nis a possibility of nesting.
Clean out 1 <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> in the Subway Remains. The\npathways are complex; the area is blocked off, \nhas elevated temperatures, and bad air flow. \nThis will be a battle under harsh conditions.
2 <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> are nesting in the Office Ruins. \nThey were our research samples, but they have \nescaped. Handle it now. <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> lack defense to\nsunder attacks to the upper body.
2 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)> are parading around the sewage\nplant. Research Unit cannot get closer.\nRetaliation Squad is requested to clean up.\nWeakness to Piercing attacks around their torso \nis indicated.
<c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> are breeding on the abandoned\nCarrier Vessel. They may pose a threat if\nneglected. Retaliation Squad requested to\neliminate the 4 Aragami. Be cautious of uneven\nground.
A Research Unit in the Bay Area has reported \nthe presence of 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>. Contact has not yet \nbeen made. Retaliation Squad requested to rush \nto the scene and destroy it. Equipping a Blaze \ntype weapon is recommended.
Eliminate 5 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> in the Chemical Factory \nRuins. Fighting multiple enemies at once can\nbe dangerous. Defeat individually. Sunder and \nPiercing close-range attacks are suggested. Any \ngun shot should be effective.
1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> confirmed in the Old City. It is alone, \ndo not let this chance pass. This agile Aragami \nuses Spark attacks and is also resistant to them.\nReports show Blaze and Divine are most effective.
2 <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> escaped the first\nRetaliation Squad and have resumed activity in \nthe Old City. Second squad requested for clean \nup. Non-Divine attacks are effective for both \nspecies.
Some resource traders who ignored our warning and\ncontinued operation in the Old City have been\ntaken prey by 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, still in the area.\nRetaliation Squad requested for clean up.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> in the Old City, surrounded by\n<c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> and <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>. Eliminate all or just\nthe target. If sniping the <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, Impact bullets\nwork on all parts of the body.
5 <c(3)>fallen Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> sighted in the Subway\nRemains. Retaliation Squad requested. Freeze\nattacks are suggested, as the enemy specializes \nin Blaze attacks. Do not enter their killzone.\n
Detected 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>, a tank-type Aragami in the\nGrasslands. Dispatch requested. Not much is known\nabout the giant other than its weakness to \nFreeze. Beware of its smaller Aragami \naccompaniments.
Detected 3 <c(3)>fallen Ogretails<c(0)> adapted to the cold.\nRetaliation Squad requested at the Temple Ruins.\nWe expect they are weak to Blaze. Beware of the\n<c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>' defense.
Defeat the 2 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fallen Ogretail<c(0)> \nin the Factory Ruins. Spark is effective against\n<c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)>, while the <c(3)>fallen Ogretail<c(0)> is \nadapted to the cold. Blaze weapons will prove \nuseful.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> before it crawls out of \nthe Subway Remains. These Aragami look like giant\nscorpions. Freeze and Spark may be effective.\nAvoiding the fallen Cocoons is suggested.
Research Unit has detected a swarm of <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> \nin the Factory Ruins. Your target is 3 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> \nand 2 <c(3)>fallen Ogretails<c(0)>. All <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> are weak to\nSunder and Piercing close-range attacks.
1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> confirmed in the Bay Area. Head to the\nlanding point and defeat it. We have found that\n<c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> have low resistance to Freeze and Divine\nattributes. Keep this in mind.
1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> was encountered by the Research Unit's\nforce reconnaissance but has escaped to the Old\nCity. Blaze or Divine weapons are recommended.\nTake caution of other smaller Aragami.
Defeat 2 <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> in the\nGrasslands. All are magmatic. Freeze is effective\nfor these fallen species. Beware of the Cocoon's\nkillzone. This is not a difficult mission.
Defeat 2 <c(3)>fallen Ogretails<c(0)> in the Grasslands. They\nare adapted to the cold, so Blaze weapons are\nadvised. The terrain is flat and <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> are on\nthe lookout. Prepare for a chaotic battle.
One more battle! This one's against 1 Borg\nCamlann. The battlefield is the Forgotten \nCarrier. It's just one, but we'll go with Freeze \nto be safe. Gotta stick to basics!
1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> has begun actively devouring in the\nTemple Ruins... I'm worried about going alone on\nthis mission. Please! Can you help me? It says\nhere they're weak to Divine and Impact. I have to\nmake sure I don't forget.
Exterminate all Aragami in the Factory Ruins. 1\n<c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> have been confirmed. The\n<c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> can move around in the air and has a high\nresistance to Divine effects. Beware, as there \nmay be others.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> in the Bay Area. Take caution, as\nnearby <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> may join in on your battle. The\nhead of a <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> is weak to crush attacks. It may\nbe worth aiming for just that.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> at the Temple\nRuins. A <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>'s torso and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>'s head\nare weak to Piercing attacks. Several <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)>\nroam the nearby area. Take caution.
Detected 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> in the Grasslands.\nThey seem to be wandering the area for weaker\nprey. There is a defense line of <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>;\ncareless entry will only cause death.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>fallen Kongou<c(0)> at the Old Temple. This\nvariant is adapted to the cold, as it spent weeks\ntraveling south. Blaze weapons are suggested.\nThere are also more smaller Aragami in the area.
Exterminate the enemy in the Grasslands. The\ntarget is 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and 1 polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, a similar\nbut different species. Spark is effective for the\n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, but the polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> is weak to Blaze.
1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> found in the Old Bay Area.\nRetaliation squad requested to rush to the scene.\nFreeze attacks are effective. Use Piercing \nbullets to the mouth. Beware of patrolling fallen\n<c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>.\n
Exterminate the Aragami at the Factory Ruins. \n1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> with Freeze and Divine resistance,\ncomplemented by 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> resistant to Blaze\nand Spark. Defeat them individually.
Rush to the Subway Remains and eliminate 1 fallen\n<c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>. Magma feels like a refreshing bath\nfor this underground Aragami. Freeze weapons are\nrecommended. Avoid the fallen Cocoons.
\nDestroy 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> at the Temple Ruins. \nFreeze or Spark weapons are recommended. <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>\nand <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> coexist in the area, but fighting \nmultiple species should be avoided.\n
I need help getting rid of a <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and Borg\nCamlann in the Old City. I have a research team\nthere, but there's been no progress because of\nthe Aragami. I'm counting on you! Oh, and take a\nFreeze weapon!
Sorry to bother again! Think you can get rid of a\n<c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> for me? Should be easy enough\nwith a Blaze weapon. They're at the Temple Ruins.\nThat place used to be so pretty...
Defeat 1 polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> at the\nabandoned Carrier Vessel. Blaze and Freeze \nweapons are recommended. Or, snipe the polar \n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>'s leg and the <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>'s head with \nCrushing weapons.
Sneak into the Subway Remains and sweep out 1\n<c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and 1 magmatic <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>. If they team \nup, it will be risky and chaotic. Luckily, both \nhave bad hearing. You should be able to separate\nthe two.
Eliminate the <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> swarm at the Temple Ruins.\nThese 4 might be a family, but that's unknown. It\nis clear however, that <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> are a social\nspecies. The pack coordinates with sharp hearing.\n
I've set up a date for Shio. A picnic on a \nCarrier! The menu? Charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>. Yes, the \nfallen species is Sparky! Grill it over some \nflames. There's <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> and <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> too, \nbut we don't want them.
Defeat 3 <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> in the Grasslands. Their \nhideout is surrounded by a <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)> defense.\nThey have relentless hit-and-run tactics which \ntrouble our Guard Squad. Burn them up with Blaze\nweapons.
Detected 2 <c(3)>fallen Kongous<c(0)> in the Old City. These\npolar species are tough to Freeze. We recommend\nBlaze weapons. Upon cleanup, the Research Unit\nplans to investigate the area for artifacts.
Destroy all targets in the Factory Ruins: 1 Borg\nCamlann and 2 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)>. Spark is effective \nfor both. <c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)> have high aquatic mobility\nand the field is watery. Beware of an ambush.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> in the \nOld City. Freeze is effective for the <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>, \nand Blaze for the charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, but Piercing\nattacks to the head are highly suggested if\npossible.
A swarm of Aragami confirmed in the Old \nUnderground City. The main threat seems to be a \n<c(3)>fallen Chi-You<c(0)> and <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboros<c(0)>. The \n<c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> have made the situation complicated. \nTake caution.
Shio's hiding near the Temple Ruins. Looks like \nthere's quite a few Aragami in the area, and the\n<c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> might be tricky. Watch out for the charged\n<c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)>. I'm counting on you to go get \nShio!
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> in the Old\nCity. Spark attacks should be effective for both.\nTo slow their movement for tactical purposes,\nconsider a weapon that can deal Piercing attacks.
Ever heard of an <c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)>? Its body as big as a\nmountain, each breath a tornado... Your target \nfor this special mission is its core. Divine \nweapons have been proven useful. I know you can \ndo this.
Take care of 1 <c(3)>fallen Quadriga<c(0)> at the Factory\nRuins. It's adapted to the cold but grew weak to\nBlaze. Evolution is quite interesting. You are\npermitted to take others on this special mission.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> in the Old City. It's a\nmagmatic fallen species that spawned from the\nearth. It's safe to assume that Freeze is\neffective. Beware of the Vajra-looking <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)>.
1 <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)> sighted at the Factory Ruins. Its\nexistence is a great threat, as it scatters\npoisonous wing scales. All elements are effective\nexcept for Divine. Beware of the smaller\nAragami as well.
Your target is 1 charged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>. Piercing\nweapons work best on its torso. You're a strong\nGods Eater. I know I can trust you. You are\npermitted to take others on this special mission.
Eliminate the 2 <c(3)>Vajras<c(0)> in the Temple Ruins. 1 is \na <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)>, which some say is a female <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>\nand others say it is a fallen species. Either \nway, Blaze and Divine are effective on both.
Defense Unit successfully cornered 3 Aragami into\nthe Subway Remains. Retaliation Squad requested \nto eliminate 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>, 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and 1 charged\n<c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>. Blaze is effective for all.
Defeat the <c(3)>fallen Quadriga<c(0)> in the Bay Area. Blaze\nis very effective. <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> swarms patrol the\narea, but they should scatter upon losing their\nprotector.
Eliminate 2 polar <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> at \nthe Temple Ruins. If this mission is successful, \nwe can secure a high level of safety. We can then\nrepair the barrier to the residential area.
1 <c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)> sighted in the Grasslands. The \ntornado is raining rubble in our residential \narea. One of our squads has previously defeated \none and reports that Divine weapons are \neffective.
Research Unit has trapped a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> in the Old\nCity after long pursuit. Destroy the evolved\n<c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>, the king of beasts, along with a Prithva\nMata in the area. Spark and Freeze are useless.
Defeat the <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> in the Old City. The \nGuard Squad is at a stalemate with the swarm of \nsmall Aragami. This icy queen is dangerous, but a\nCrushing blow to the head should determine its\nfate.
Defeat 1 magmatic <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fallen <c(0)>\n<c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> in the Grasslands. Freeze weapons are \nrecommended. A camera man was killed by the \npoison wing scales, but his photos could be very\nprecious records.
Can you take Shio out to the Carrier? She needs\nfood! The <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)> looks strong and\nnutritious. Divine has been proven effective, \nbut its main weakness is its face. You can \nignore the other Aragami.
Go to the Factory Ruins and defeat 1 magmatic \n<c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)>: one normal, one \ncharged. Use Freeze on the magmatic Aragami. \nBlaze or Piercing attacks to the head are \nsuggested for the <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)>.
Your target is 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, a fallen species\nadapted to the cold. Crushing weapons can split\nits forehead. Keep up the good work. You are\npermitted to take others on this special \nmission. 
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> at the Chemical\nFactory Ruins. <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> is weak to Freeze and\nDivine. The area was clear, but these mysterious\nAragami seem to have spawned from the sludge.
Our goal is to investigate a special core \nreaction in the Old Bay Area, but we've got a \n<c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> in our way. Little is known about \nthe species, but we think Divine is effective. \nIt's your call.
The earthquakes in the past few days were being\ncaused by a <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> and <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> underground.\nCrush attacks to the head are effective for both.\nBeware of the <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)> in the same subway.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> that have\nescaped to the Temple Ruins after taking some \nbarrier construction workers as prey. Polar \n<c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> and <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> should be eliminated\nif possible.
Aragami might not get sick, but they get hungry,\nthat's for sure. There's a magmatic <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> \nand a <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> in the Subway Remains. A Freeze \nweapon should do the job. Let's feed Shio some \nGboro fin soup.
Next on the menu is an <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> at Temple \nRuins... and 1 <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)>. I'd suggest you \ntake Divine weapons. It'll work for both. \nIt's not that bad taking care of a \nhigh-maintenance girl, is it Soma?
Let's feed Shio a <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>. They say \nscorpions are used in Chinese medicine, so we \nmight as well try. Go catch me some in the \nGrasslands, there is one charged and one \nmagmatic. Be sure to take a Freeze weapon!\n\n
The branch director has abandoned his post and\nbetrayed humanity. I, Tsubaki Amamiya, will act \non my conscience and proceed to stop his scheme. \nI am not forcing you, but help is appreciated.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> sighted underground. We've heard\nthat Freeze works, but it is up to you to try.\n<c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)>'s awakening seems to be stirring the\nAragami. Be on alert for stronger species.
The Factory Ruins became an Aragami nest while\nFenrir's chain of command was in chaos. Rush to\nthe scene and eliminate 1 polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, 1\n<c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, and 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>. Blaze and Spark\nweapons are suggested.
An <c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)> has begun activity in the \nGrasslands. This rare species has become quite \ncommon and though we know that it is weak to \nDivine, a giant free-roaming Aragami should still\nbe of concern.
The Aragami threat in the Subway Remains seems \nto be one of the causes in the delay in our \nwater and air duct construction. We need 1 \n<c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> eliminated. \nFreeze is effective.\n
A new species of Aragami has decended on Aegis.\nThe strategic unit has named it <c(3)>Aether<c(0)>, but it\nlooks like a <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> and its defenses are believed\nto be similar. A polar <c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> is also in the \narea.
Wipe out the Aragami in the Old City. The target\nis 1 magmatic <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 1 polar <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>.\nBeware of its opposite Blaze-and-Freeze\ncombination.
Eliminate 2 polar <c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)> at the Chemical\nFactory Ruins. Fenrir PR seeks to make use of\nAragami waste to secure resources. Note that this\nincludes reusing <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> skin as alligator\nhide.
Eliminate all Aragami in the Subway Remains: 1\n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, 1 <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)>. \nCrush the <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>'s face and shoot the <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)>'s \nbody with anti-air shots.
There's a <c(3)>fallen Ouroboros<c(0)> on Aegis. It's rare \nand nobody's fought one before, so I bet it's \nworth a lot. We'll split the reward half-and-\nhalf, wanna help me out? I read that Divine is \neffective.
Destroy 1 charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, 1 <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, and 1 Dyaus\nPita in the Subways. Head shots are \neffective. Pierce works for the charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> \nand <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, and sunder for the <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)>.
Defeat the polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and charged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>\nin the Old Bay Area. I suggest the use of bullets\nwith Impact effects. It should be able to blast \nthe <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>'s face and destroy the Borg's arms.
Head to the Grasslands and intercept the Aragami\nheaded to the residential area. Your target is 1\n<c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> and 1 charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>. A Piercing\nbullet to the head should deal the fatal blow.
The Lovely Lindow Luring Lineup!! Let's take some\ngirls and walk around the Temple Ruins. There are\nreports of a <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Fallen Sariel<c(0)>, so\nmake sure to take lotsa Piercing bullets!
A magmatic <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> has been\nsighted in the Factory Ruins. Eliminate these\nusing Impact bullets on the <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>'s arms\nand <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>'s head.
Intercept 1 <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> in the Old\nCity. Shots to the <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)>'s torso is effective.\nPiercing shots to the <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)>'s hind legs\nshould slow them down.
<c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)> is showing signs of recovery. Rush to\nAegis and destroy it. They are a pair and their\ndefense is balanced, but the female seems to have\nan overall lower resistance than the male.
An abnormal power surge was detected in the \nTemple Ruins. It seems the source is 1 charged \n<c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, but 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)> are \nalso found. Eliminate this with Divine and Blaze \nweapons.
The Squad requested to repel 2 Aragami in\nthe Bay Area. The target is 1 polar <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>\nand 1 <c(3)>Aether<c(0)>. Guns are required against <c(3)>Aether<c(0)>, \nand Impact shots are effective on the\n<c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>'s arm.
I overheard they saw Kanon at Aegis Island. But\nAegis Island is a danger zone right now with a\n<c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)>, charged <c(3)>Vajratails<c(0)>, and magmatic\n<c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>! Please help Kanon! Please!
Defeat 2 <c(3)>Vajras<c(0)> in the Old Bay Area. The Guard \nSquad has managed to push the enemy back to the \nCarrier. Retaliation Squad will enter from the \nside. A Blaze or Divine weapon is suggested.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> on Aegis. We strongly\nsuggest a crush type Divine weapon. A cult was\nfound sacrificing a human to it earlier. The\nvictim is thought to be a kidnapped man.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> and 2 magmatic <c(3)>Gboro-Gboros<c(0)> \nin the Subway. Beware of the warm enviroment. \nImpact shots are effective in destroying the \n<c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>'s lower body and the <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>'s fins.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 polar <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> in the\nTemple Ruins. Shoot the front legs with Impact\nShots and crush their heads. The Research Unit is\nawaiting rescue, along with an antiques dealer, \nin the back building.
Defeat 2 polar <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)> at the\nstranded Carrier. Use Impact shots on the polar\nspecies, and Crushing melee attacks for the\nfierce. They work as a team, so prepare for group\ncombat.
An unknown Aragami has appeared in the \nGrasslands. The strategic unit concludes this is\na <c(3)>fallen Arda Nova<c(0)>. Its appearance on the \nlifeless field is indeed divine. Quickly ambush \nthis enemy.
Defeat polar fallen species at the temple. \n1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, and 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>.\nBlaze weapons and melee Piercing attacks to the \nGboro's mouth, <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>'s arm, and <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>'s upper\nbody.
Destroy the 2 Aragami in the Old City. The\ncharged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> is weak to Blaze, the\n<c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> to Divine. We must destroy the\nkidnapper cult's spirit. Make sure this "god" is\nslain.

Rush to the Factory Ruins and defeat 1 polar\n<c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)>. Blaze weapons are\nadvised. The toxic lake is home to the <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)>.\nTeach it a lesson: there is no resting place for\nAragami.
Clean out 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 charged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>\nfrom the Subway Remains. A crush attack to the\n<c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>'s head and pierce attack to the charged\n<c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>'s upper body should prove effective.
Targets sighted in the Old City: 1 <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, 1\n<c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)>, 1 polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and 1 polar\n<c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>. Fighting multiple species at once \ncan be very dangerous. Try to separate them.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> in the\nFactory Ruins. Divine weapons should prove \nuseful. To note, a search was executed on the \ncult, and all suspicious persons have been found.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Sekhmets<c(0)> nesting \nin the Temple Ruins. Blaze and Freeze weapons are\nsuggested. The bracelet and left arm of a runaway\nrookie was found. Assume the rest of his body was\neaten.
A convoy delivering materials from Aegis was\nattacked by an <c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)>, which have no \nweakness to note. Retaliation Squad requested on \nsite. The Guard Squad will secure your escape \nroute.
Rush to the Old Bay Area and defeat 1 <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)>\nand 1 charged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>. The charged Borg's\nhead is weak to Blaze, while sunder is effective \non the head and front legs of the <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)>.
Defeat 1 charged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Aether<c(0)> in the\nTemple Ruins. Blaze equipment is required. Side\nnote: The <c(3)>Aether<c(0)> attracts the most attention in\nFenrir PR's "Gods Eater vs Aragami" photo book.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> on\nAegis. Take a trusty Divine weapon with you. \nSlash the emperor's forehead with a sunder \nattack, and the queen's head with a crush attack.
Retaliation Squad requested to defeat 1 fallen\n<c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)> in the Grasslands. Divine is effective,\nbut the reason is unknown. We don't know where\nthey come from, but we must defeat them all. 
The <c(3)>fallen Arda Nova<c(0)> has returned to Aegis. There\nis a public live broadcast, which means this \nbattle will represent us. No weakness of this \nAragami has been found. Good luck in battle.

Incoming reports of <c(3)>Zeus<c(0)>, a Type 2 Deusphage, on\nAegis. This rare species has gained a sturdy \nbody from devouring each other. Put together an \nelite team for this mission.
A single <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> has appeared at the Factory\nRuins. Eliminate immediately. This one is\nstrong, but should be easy if you go in\nstronger with Spark-resistant equipment.
A <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> attracted to the lava needs\nto be dealt with in the Subways. The basic tactic\nwould be to avoid the enemy's ranged attack. Take\na Freeze weapon and heat-resistant armor.

Local cold spots have made <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> develop \nbipolar habitats, and there seems to be a lone \n<c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> in the Old City. Prepare yourself \nin Divine gear and make use of this chance.
Eliminate one <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> in the Bay Area. This\ntask isn't usually assigned to veteran Gods \nEaters but this one's grown to become dangerous.\nDon't let your guard down and you should be fine.
We request the elimination of the increasing\nnumbers of <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboros<c(0)> in the Underground\nCity. Just take a Freeze type weapon and the\nsuccess of this mission can be assured.

A <c(3)>fallen Borg Camlann<c(0)> with resistance to heat is\ninterfering with a retrieval mission at the\nChemical Plant. Chemicals can become a threat, so\nwe need it gone, quick. The key is to take Freeze\ngear.
The Research Unit reported a large fire in the \nOld City last night. This was determined to be \ncaused by a <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>'s sudden rampage behavior. \nDestroy this with Freeze type bullets.

Search for the remainders of the recent <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>\noutbreak. What a lame job... Whatever, let's do\nit. They're <c(3)>fallen Chi-Yous<c(0)>, so we'll take Spark \ngear. We don't wanna die, right?
Confirmed <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> activity in the Old City. This\nindividual has devoured many times and has\nstronger abilities than normal. Do not\nunderestimate it, and do not let your guard down.
A cold habitat <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> has wandered into the\nTemple Ruins. Research Unit has confirmed no\nother enemies, so now would be the chance to\ndestroy it. Go quickly with fire attributed gear.
A <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> has escaped the large scale \ndefensive battle by the Third Squad. We were \ninformed that it is hiding in the Carrier. It is \nnot hurt and still poses a threat. First Squad \nrequested on site.
Retrieval Squad has encountered a <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> in the\nFactory Ruins. It seems to be alone, and should \nbe easy to defeat. Take each type of gear and\neliminate it.
Dr. Sakaki asked me to go get stuff, but I can't\nhold it all, so I'm glad you're here to help. Go\nto the Carrier on the coast for stuff off of a\ncharged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>. Don't forget your Blaze\nweapon.

As if mocking our brief moment of peace,\n<c(3)>Amaterasu<c(0)>, a Type 1 Deusphage, has landed on \nAegis. This can become a great threat to the \nworld. Strike the goddess in the head, as that is\nits weak spot.

They've found someone that looks like Kanon at \nthe Carrier. I want to help Annette to go find \nher, but there's a <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> nearby so we \nworry about going alone. You'll come with us, \nright?
There's a report of a <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> with a large\nblade-gash in the Old City. I think Brendan gave\nit that gash. Please! I need to help him this\ntime... Let's make sure we can defend against\nFreeze.

Reader's Mission:\nDestroy 1 <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Sekhmets<c(0)> at the\nChemical Factory Ruins. They've evolved into much\nstronger individuals, but show them that Gods\nEaters are evolving too.
Reader's Mission:\nEliminate the <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> in the Temple area. \nIt is rare for <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> to herd in one area,\nbut if left alone, they could become a stampede.\nImmediate response is requested.
Reader's Mission:\nLooks like a strange core was detected in the Old\nCity. But... hmm. The pattern suggests it's an\n<c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)>, but it's kind of weird. Can you go \ncheck this out?
Reader's Mission:\nSo, uhh... I've been thinking. I'm really bad at\naiming compared to the others. If you have some\ntime, can you come train with me?
Reader's Mission:\nTwo rare Type 1 Deusphages in one area!? That's\nscary. Well, sadly, I think you're the only one\nwho can stand a chance against them, so... Good\nluck!
Reader's Mission:\nA <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)>, <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)>, and  <c(3)>Dyaus<c(0)>\n<c(3)>Pita<c(0)>. A total of 4 reactions were detected at\nAegis. They are quite dangerous alone, but only\nyou can get rid of all of t
Reader's Mission:\nA group of small Aragami have appeared at the\nCarrier Vessel. The individuals have evolved \nquite rapidly, and though small, their numbers \nare extraordinary. Stay on guard, and wipe them \nout.
Reader's Mission:\nA <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> has appeared in the Old City. We\nbelieve this to be the head of a nearby pack of\n<c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)>, so we want to get this leader out \nof the way. We wish you the best of luck.
<c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)>, a Type 1 Deusphage, is also known as \nthe Gods Eater killer because of its taste for \narcs. Its blade-like tail is its weakness, but \ncan also deal great damage. Take care in dealing \nwith this.
It's theorized that the rare <c(3)>Golden Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> \nis just a gluttonous mutant. Rare metals can be\nobtained to upgrade your weapons. Gods Eaters\nbelieve meeting one is a sign of good luck.
Requesting defeat of a <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>\nin the Old City. Quickly rush to the scene. They\nare powerful, and not to be underestimated. Be\nsure to upgrade your armor against Crushing \nattacks.
A new resource transportation route using the\nsubway system is being built right now, but a\n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> have interrupted this\nproject. Focus on attacking their heads to\neliminate them.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> in the Grasslands... This \nmission is probably way too easy for you, I know,\nbut we have to do it. This is where we start. \nReady?!
Thanks for last time! I feel a lot more confident\nnow. Okay, next-up is a <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> in\nthe Grasslands. Spark attacks work for both. \nLet's do our best!
Your attacks are weakening the Aragami threat.\nMost of these reports are for small ones now. \nLike this: a group of <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> in the Old City.\nThis might sound easy, but never underestimate\nthe Aragami.\n
<c(3)>Fallen Zygotes<c(0)> have been tracked at the Temple\nRuins. It seems these small ones are popping up a\nlot these days, maybe because of the lack of the\nbigger ones. This needs to be dealt with quickly.
A large Aragami has been detected in the\nMarshlands. Info suggests this to be a <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)>.\nHowever, we have no record of its successful\ndefeat. Its Blaze attacks will require serious\ncaution.
We lost contact with a Gods Eater near the Old\nCity, and at the same time, a <c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)> was\nsighted, which seems to be the cause. We cannot\nleave this Type 1 Deusphage loose. Eliminate this\nnow.
We've successfully trapped <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> in the\nSubway Remains. It is impossible to destroy with\nour current weapons, so the main priority is to\nretrieve the core. Return immediately after.
One polar-adapted <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> has been found in the\nTemple Ruins. We've also received reports of a\n<c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> nearby. Neutralize this threat quickly.\nAnd make sure to go fully prepared.
A magmatic <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and a polar <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>\nhave been detected in the Grasslands. You may \nhave to fight them at the same time, and it won't\nbe easy. Pull them apart and destroy them both.
Can you go get me some materials to fix Lindow's\nArc? I know you can get them in the Old City, but\nthere's a <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> nearby. Piercing\nattacks work for both, so go prepared. And \nthanks!
You'll find Black <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> at the Aegis. Listen\nclosely, you're the only one who can hurt it. Its\nBlaze attacks are strong, so make sure that you\nare fully equipped. I'm sure you know by now.
To get out of here, we need to follow Lindow's\nfootsteps. We'll start at the Subway Remains. He\ndefeated <c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)> there. I'll help you, but\n<c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)> is strong. Divine is its weakness. Now,\nlet's go.
Lindow fought a Deusphage Aragami alone. He said\nhe was going on a date that day. Remember that?\nNext is an <c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)> in the Grasslands. It was a\ntough fight for him. I'll support you. We can do\nit.
This is the last battle. Black <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> is inside\nthe church in the Old City. There's no specific\nweakness, so be careful. Hurry, we don't have \nmuch time. Are you ready? Please, save Lindow!
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> and a <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)> have taken over\nAegis. Their dance-like movements and strong \nattacks can be stunning but don't let them \nconfuse you. Drag them down to the ground and \nsmash their heads.\n
Challenge Mission:\nWe've received reports of an outbreak of Cocoon\nMaidens in the Factory Ruins. They seem to have\nevolved an immunity to gun attacks, so you'll \nhave to hunt each one down with your sword.
Challenge Mission:\nThe return of <c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)>, what we all feared, has\ncome true. Two scouts on Aegis have already \nfallen victim. Gather a team and destroy it \nimmediately.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>fallen Borg Camlann<c(0)>. Did you\nknow, the mats you can get off these guys can \nsell for real high? Come equipped in Spark gear,\nalright? Let's go, we're headed to the Carrier\nVessel.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>fallen Zygote<c(0)> and a charged <c(3)>Vajratail<c(0)>. Damn,\nit's just trash... Hey, you. Come along. It's got\nnothing to do with the <c(3)>Amaterasu<c(0)> nearby! I'm just\noffering to split the prize with you.
Challenge Mission:\nShooting down a flying Aragami is pretty hard, \nbut it feels so good. There's a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and its \nfallen species, plus a <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)> in the \nFactory Ruins. So? Wanna come with me?
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)> has been sited again. I'm not really \nup for it, but it's my job. It's in the Old City.\nThere's a polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> with it so but it's kinda \nhard for me to do alone. Please help!
Challenge Mission:\nSorry to bug you. Um... Can you come with me for\nmy gun training session? The target is a <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>\nand a <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)>. I thought I'd practice on big\nenemies first. And, thank you, in advance!
Challenge Mission:\nThe Aragami in the Old City have all disappeared.\nWe sent in scouts and found a <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> and\n<c(3)>corrosive Hannibal<c(0)> there. Eliminate this threat\nimmediately.
Challenge Mission:\nI heard <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)>'s popped up again. He's gotten \nus good a few times now, so I need to get \nrevenge! There's a <c(3)>fallen Chi-You<c(0)> in the area, \nbut if we team up, they're no match for us!
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>fallen Kongou<c(0)>, <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, and\n<c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> are headed here. Avert them at the\nCarrier. Team up with the Second Squad and \ndefend.
Challenge Mission:\nThe Factory Ruins are covered in thicker fog,\ncaused by the melting of <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)>'s ice by\n<c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)>'s heat. The visibility is bad. Go fully\ngeared.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> with a polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>Gboro-<c(0)>\n<c(3)>Gboro<c(0)> servants have descended on the Temple \nRuins. Use Blaze weapons to hammer away at her \nfrozen defenses.
Challenge Mission:\nThe <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, and <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> are\nsome Aragami that adapted to the magma when the\nearth erupted. Now, they have gathered in the\nSubways. Go now and extinguish this threat.
Challenge Mission:\nThe last contact we had with our squad \ninvestigating Aegis was that they saw Aragami. \nIt is believed to be a <c(3)>Tsukuyomi<c(0)> and a <c(3)>fallen <c(0)>\n<c(3)>Sariel<c(0)>. Secure Aegis so that we can deploy a \nsearch team.
Challenge Mission:\nOur communication equipment seems to malfunction\nin the Grasslands. A charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, Fierce\n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> have been sighted there. They \nmay not be the actual cause, but get rid of them.
Challenge Mission:\nA herd of <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> have been detected at the\nTemple Ruins again. A <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, <c(3)>Fallen Kongou<c(0)> and 2\n<c(3)>Fierce Kongous<c(0)> are wreaking havoc as if\nrepresenting the anger of the abandoned statues.
Challenge Mission:\nSuddenly, a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> appeared on Aegis and \ndestroyed our defense force. Head to Aegis and\neliminate it now. It's an emergency and we\ncannot secure more staff. Give your full \nattention to this mission.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> and <c(3)>corrosive Hannibal<c(0)> seem to have\nwiped out the Aragami on Aegis. The two have\ndevoured everything. They are strong, and much \ntoo dangerous to be left alive. We need them \ndefeated, now.
Challenge Mission:\nDefeat the <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> in the Grasslands. This area \nhas become dangerous due to the two fallen\n<c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> and two <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> that are flying rampant.\nBeware of air strikes that can come from\nanywhere.
Challenge Mission:\nFour Aragami have been detected in the Chemical\nFactory Ruins. We believe them to be Cocoon\nMaidens and <c(3)>fallen Ogretails<c(0)>. Don't underestimate\nthem. Keep an eye out above and behind you.
Challenge Mission:\nThere was a plan to shut down Aegis before it\nbecame an Aragami nest, but a <c(3)>fallen Kongou<c(0)>,\n<c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>\nhave been detected. Eliminate them now.
Challenge Mission:\nAn <c(3)>Aether<c(0)> and <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> have appeared at the\nTemple Ruins. This has caused a <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)>\ninfestation. Fighting in their range can be\ndangerous. Pay attention.
Challenge Mission:\nA battle between a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> and a corrosive\n<c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> has been sighted on Aegis. We cannot\nignore the havoc being wreaked. Make sure to\nsupress them before Aegis is destroyed.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> and <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> are being tracked \nat the closed off church. A battle in a small \narea with nowhere to run can become harsh. Watch \nfor their attacks and aim to destroy their heads.
1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> have scattered the\nDefense Unit. Our defenses have been broken\nand they've traveled into the Old City.\nWe will divide into units and maintain our \ndefense. Good luck.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> in the Factory\nRuins. Keep your eyes on the target. You might be\nable to split them up if you plan well. Best of\nluck!
A <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, and 2 <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> have been\ndetected in the Old City. The exact location has\nnot yet been confirmed. Beware of an ambush, and \nhide if you are surrounded by them.
1 <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> confirmed in the Old City. Eliminate\nas soon as possible. Research identifies the\nouter skin of <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> to be vulnerable to \npierce attacks. Mission time is 30 minutes. \nGood luck.
2 <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> confirmed in the Grasslands.\nThese Aragami are weak to Impact. Weapons with\nsunder attacks are recommended. Mission time \nis 30 minutes. Good luck.
4 Aragami sighted in the Factory Ruins, \nidentified as <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> and <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)>. Make\nuse of the divided terrain to lure the <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> \naway from the immobile <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)> and defeat\nindividually.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> in the Factory Ruins.\nSpark is proven to be effective on this large\nbeast. <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> also confirmed in the area. \nAvoid conflict and bring down your target.
Confirmed multiple Aragami activity in the Old\nCity. Subdue 1 <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>\nthere. All attacks, except Divine, are effective\nagainst both species.
Received report of 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> invasion to the \nTemple Ruins, home to 3 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)>. Quickly \neliminate them all. Keep in mind, <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> has low \nSpark and Blaze resistance, but has keen hearing.
Aragami are herding in the Temple Ruins. Rush to\nthe scene and clear out the 3 <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>. They will \nalert others of your presence, so defeat them \nquickly. There seem to be <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> as well.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and 3 <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> in the Old City.\nPierce attacks to the leg slow <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> movement.\nCrush attacks to the face should deal a fatal\nblow. Avoid its air and ground tactics with\n<c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>.
3 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> are hiding at the Temple Ruins.\nThey're more intelligent, which explains why they\ncoexist with <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>. Don't get\noverwhelmed. Make sure to defeat them all.
Defeat the rampaging <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> at the Subway \nRemains. They are very mobile, but are weak to\ndeep Freeze. Battle will take place in a narrow\nunderpass. Make sure to secure your escape route.
2 <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> are nesting in the Office Ruins. \nThey were our research samples, but they have \nescaped. Handle it now. <c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> lack defense to\nsunder attacks to the upper body.
<c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> are breeding on the abandoned\nCarrier Vessel. They may pose a threat if\nneglected. Retaliation Squad requested to\neliminate the 4 Aragami. Be cautious of uneven\nground.
Eliminate 5 <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> in the Chemical Factory \nRuins. Fighting multiple enemies at once can\nbe dangerous. Defeat individually. Sunder and \nPiercing close-range attacks are suggested. Any \ngun shot should be effective.
1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> confirmed in the Old City. It is alone, \ndo not let this chance pass. This agile Aragami \nuses Spark attacks and is also resistant to them.\nReports show Blaze and Divine are most effective.
Some resource traders who ignored our warning and\ncontinued operation in the Old City have been\ntaken prey by 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, still in the area.\nRetaliation Squad requested for clean up.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> in the Old City, surrounded by\n<c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> and <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)>. Eliminate all or just\nthe target. If sniping the <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, Impact bullets\nwork on all parts of the body.
Detected 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>, a tank-type Aragami in the\nGrasslands. Dispatch requested. Not much is known\nabout the giant other than its weakness to \nFreeze. Beware of its smaller Aragami \naccompaniments.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> before it crawls out of \nthe Subway Remains. These Aragami look like giant\nscorpions. Freeze and Spark may be effective.\nAvoiding the fallen Cocoons is suggested.
1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> was encountered by the Research Unit's\nforce reconnaissance but has escaped to the Old\nCity. Blaze or Divine weapons are recommended.\nTake caution of other smaller Aragami.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> in the Bay Area. Destroying\nits hard armor and needle tail should be a \npriority. Freeze weapons will help get this done \nquickly.
1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> has begun actively devouring in the\nTemple Ruins. Divine weapons are proven valid.\nParts of a <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> are weak to Impact; Crushing\nweapons are thought to have a slight advantage.
Exterminate all Aragami in the Factory Ruins. 1\n<c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> have been confirmed. The\n<c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> can move around in the air and has a high\nresistance to Divine effects. Beware, as there \nmay be others.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> in the Bay Area. Take caution, as\nnearby <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)> may join in on your battle. The\nhead of a <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> is weak to crush attacks. It may\nbe worth aiming for just that.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> at the Temple\nRuins. A <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>'s torso and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>'s head\nare weak to Piercing attacks. Several <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)>\nroam the nearby area. Take caution.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>fallen Kongou<c(0)> at the Old Temple. This\nvariant is adapted to the cold, as it spent weeks\ntraveling south. Blaze weapons are suggested.\nThere are also more smaller Aragami in the area.
\nDestroy 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> at the Temple Ruins. \nFreeze or Spark weapons are recommended. <c(3)>Zygotes<c(0)>\nand <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> coexist in the area, but fighting \nmultiple species should be avoided.\n
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> nesting in\nthe Old City. Freeze weapons are advised. Use a\ncrush attack on the <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>'s hind legs to\nstop its movement.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> in the Temple\nRuins. Blaze weapons are advised. The upper body\nof a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> is weak to melee sunder attacks and\nPiercing gun attacks. These should prove useful.
Sneak into the Subway Remains and sweep out 1\n<c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and 1 magmatic <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>. If they team \nup, it will be risky and chaotic. Luckily, both \nhave bad hearing. You should be able to separate\nthe two.
Eliminate the <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> swarm at the Temple Ruins.\nThese 4 might be a family, but that's unknown. It\nis clear however, that <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> are a social\nspecies. The pack coordinates with sharp hearing.\n
Eliminate 1 charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> at the Carrier Vessel.\nBlaze weapons are advised. Aiming for the head\nwith Piercing attacks is also effective. Beware of\nsmaller Aragami in the area.
Detected 2 <c(3)>fallen Kongous<c(0)> in the Old City. These\npolar species are tough to Freeze. We recommend\nBlaze weapons. Upon cleanup, the Research Unit\nplans to investigate the area for artifacts.
A <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> has been sighted above the Temple \nRuins. The head is weak to direct attacks but \nsince it's in the air and smaller Aragami \nsurround the area, you may have to snipe its \ntorso from afar.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and 2 <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> in the Old\nCity. Spark attacks should be effective for both.\nTo slow their movement for tactical purposes,\nconsider a weapon that can deal Piercing attacks.
A tornado has been detected in the Grasslands,\ncaused by an <c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)>. Retaliation Squad\nrequested to eliminate the root of disaster. Crush\nattacks to the legs may be the most effective.
Eliminate the 2 <c(3)>Vajras<c(0)> in the Temple Ruins. 1 is \na <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)>, which some say is a female <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>\nand others say it is a fallen species. Either \nway, Blaze and Divine are effective on both.
Defense Unit successfully cornered 3 Aragami into\nthe Subway Remains. Retaliation Squad requested \nto eliminate 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>, 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and 1 charged\n<c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>. Blaze is effective for all.
Defeat the <c(3)>fallen Quadriga<c(0)> in the Bay Area. Blaze\nis very effective. <c(3)>Ogretail<c(0)> swarms patrol the\narea, but they should scatter upon losing their\nprotector.
Eliminate 2 polar <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> at \nthe Temple Ruins. If this mission is successful, \nwe can secure a high level of safety. We can then\nrepair the barrier to the residential area.
Research Unit has trapped a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> in the Old\nCity after long pursuit. Destroy the evolved\n<c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>, the king of beasts, along with a Prithva\nMata in the area. Spark and Freeze are useless.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)> in the Bay Area. The \nGuard Squad has retreated after losing 40% of \nits force. Focus on attacking the face, though \nthe smaller species may make things more difficult.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> at the Chemical\nFactory Ruins. <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> is weak to Freeze and\nDivine. The area was clear, but these mysterious\nAragami seem to have spawned from the sludge.
Retaliation Squad is requested to destroy the\n<c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> in the Old Bay Area. Understand \nthat this Aragami should be feared. From what we\nknow, it may be worth trying Divine attacks.
The earthquakes in the past few days were being\ncaused by a <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> and <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> underground.\nCrush attacks to the head are effective for both.\nBeware of the <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)> in the same subway.
Destroy 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> that have\nescaped to the Temple Ruins after taking some \nbarrier construction workers as prey. Polar \n<c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> and <c(3)>Cocoon Maidens<c(0)> should be eliminated\nif possible.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and 1 magmatic <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> in\nthe Subway Remains. Both the <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)>'s head and\n<c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>'s forehead are weak to crush attacks.\nFocus fire on one at a time to make things easier.
Eliminate the Aragami interfering with our\nexcavation at the Temple Ruins. The target is 1\n<c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> and 1 <c(3)>fierce Kongou<c(0)>. Divine weapons are\nadvised. Slashing attacks are effective for both.
Eliminate the <c(3)>fallen Borg Camlann<c(0)>. There is 1 \ncharged and 1 magmatic in the Grasslands. \nBlaze and Freeze weapons are required. \nTheir tails are weak to sunder attacks, so cut \nthem off to lower the danger.\n
Vital response from <c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)> has been confirmed\non Aegis. Retaliation Squad must take caution when\nfighting it. We do not know its weakness, or if it\neven has one. We pray for your safe return.
Defeat 1 <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> sighted underground. We've heard\nthat Freeze works, but it is up to you to try.\n<c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)>'s awakening seems to be stirring the\nAragami. Be on alert for stronger species.
A new species of Aragami has decended on Aegis.\nThe strategic unit has named it <c(3)>Aether<c(0)>, but it\nlooks like a <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> and its defenses are believed\nto be similar. A polar <c(3)>Zygote<c(0)> is also in the \narea.
There's a <c(3)>fallen Ouroboros<c(0)> on Aegis. It's rare \nand nobody's fought one before, so I bet it's \nworth a lot. We'll split the reward half-and-\nhalf, wanna help me out? I read that Divine is \neffective.
Aragami activity confirmed in the Temple Ruins.\nRetaliation Squad requested to eliminate 1 Prithvi\nMata (hind legs are weak to Piercing bullets) and\n1 <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)> (all shots are effective).
<c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)> is showing signs of recovery. Rush to\nAegis and destroy it. They are a pair and their\ndefense is balanced, but the female seems to have\nan overall lower resistance than the male.
1 <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> activity confirmed on Aegis. A \nDivine weapon is suggested. This area is a \ndanger zone, with roaming charged <c(3)>Vajratail<c(0)> \nand a thriving colony of magmatic Cocoon\nMaidens.
An unknown Aragami has appeared in the \nGrasslands. The strategic unit concludes this is\na <c(3)>fallen Arda Nova<c(0)>. Its appearance on the \nlifeless field is indeed divine. Quickly ambush \nthis enemy.
The Research Unit monitoring an <c(3)>Aether<c(0)> in the Old\nCity was ambushed by a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)>. They succeeded\nin retreat at a cost. The 2 Aragami must be\ndefeated. Blaze or Divine weapons are \nrecommended.
Clean out 1 <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> and 1 charged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>\nfrom the Subway Remains. A crush attack to the\n<c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>'s head and pierce attack to the charged\n<c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>'s upper body should prove effective.
Polar adapted <c(3)>fallen Kongous<c(0)> are popping up in \nthe Grasslands, possibly due to the sudden cold\nweather. There aren't too many yet, so we want\nthem gone now. Carry out the task using Blaze\nweapons.
The Research Unit reported a large fire in the \nOld City last night. This was determined to be \ncaused by a <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>'s sudden rampage behavior. \nDestroy this with Freeze type bullets.
Search for the remainders of the recent <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>\noutbreak. What a lame job... Whatever, let's do\nit. They're <c(3)>fallen Chi-Yous<c(0)>, so we'll take Spark \ngear. We don't wanna die, right?
Dr. Sakaki asked me to go get stuff, but I can't\nhold it all, so I'm glad you're here to help. Go\nto the Carrier on the coast for stuff off of a\ncharged <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)>. Don't forget your Blaze\nweapon.
As if mocking our brief moment of peace,\n<c(3)>Amaterasu<c(0)>, a Type 1 Deusphage, has landed on \nAegis. This can become a great threat to the \nworld. Strike the goddess in the head, as that is\nits weak spot.
A <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> has been found in the Subway\nRemains. Its ability to swim in magma suggests \nit is a fallen species. Expect harsh heat \nconditions. Prepare yourself accordingly.
We've received data about a <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)> near \nthe abandoned Carrier Vessel. Its core will be \na valuable research specimen. Attack with \nPiercing bullets to ensure its defeat.
A <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> has appeared in the Old City. \nThis ice queen has an icy aura and has strong \nFreeze attacks. One careless move can cost you\nyour life. Be cautious, and smash its head with \nCrushing blows.
<c(3)>Tsukuyomi<c(0)>, a Type 1 Deusphage, appeared on Aegis.\nIts moonlight aura and elegant appearance can be\ndeceiving, as it has world-devouring potential.\nBreak apart its halos and destroy it immediately.
Requesting defeat of a <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>\nin the Old City. Quickly rush to the scene. They\nare powerful, and not to be underestimated. Be\nsure to upgrade your armor against Crushing \nattacks.
A new resource transportation route using the\nsubway system is being built right now, but a\n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> have interrupted this\nproject. Focus on attacking their heads to\neliminate them.
Eliminate 1 <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> sighted in the Grasslands. \nIt's a troublesome Aragami that swiftly flies on\nthe open Grasslands. Destroy the wings with guns\nand make sure to supress it so that it won't fly \naround again.
Requesting defeat of a <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)> seen\nin the Grasslands. Spark seems to be effective for\nboth. Consider this when selecting your weapon. It\nmay be a long fight. Prepare accordingly.
Your attacks are weakening the Aragami threat.\nMost of these reports are for small ones now. \nLike this: a group of <c(3)>Ogretails<c(0)> in the Old City.\nThis might sound easy, but never underestimate\nthe Aragami.\n
<c(3)>Fallen Zygotes<c(0)> have been tracked at the Temple\nRuins. It seems these small ones are popping up a\nlot these days, maybe because of the lack of the\nbigger ones. This needs to be dealt with quickly.
A large Aragami has been detected in the\nMarshlands. Info suggests this to be a <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)>.\nHowever, we have no record of its successful\ndefeat. Its Blaze attacks will require serious\ncaution.
We lost contact with a Gods Eater near the Old\nCity, and at the same time, a <c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)> was\nsighted, which seems to be the cause. We cannot\nleave this Type 1 Deusphage loose. Eliminate this\nnow.
<c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> has been successfully cornered in the\nSubways. It will burst into flames and become\nvicious when its wing Oracle Cells are unbound.\nIt will unleash powerful attacks to keep you\naway, so watch out for the attacks from behind.
One polar-adapted <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)> has been found in the\nTemple Ruins. We've also received reports of a\n<c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> nearby. Neutralize this threat quickly.\nAnd make sure to go fully prepared.
A magmatic <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> and a polar <c(3)>Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>\nhave been detected in the Grasslands. You may \nhave to fight them at the same time, and it won't\nbe easy. Pull them apart and destroy them both.
Can you go get me some materials to fix this Arc?\nI know you can get them in the Old City, but\nthere's a <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> and <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> nearby. Piercing\nattacks work for both, so go prepared. Thanks!
Black <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> has been sighted at the Aegis.\nThere is not much information on how to defeat \nit, however, we know that it deals strong Blaze\nattacks. Adjust your gear accordingly.
This is an emergency mission. <c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)>, a Type 1\nDeusphage, has been found in the Subways. It has\ndevoured many Gods Eaters already. Destroy it \nwith Divine weapons before you become its prey.
The fearful giant, <c(3)>Ouroboros<c(0)> has been sighted in\nthe Marshlands. It's said that earthquakes are\ncaused by this dangerous beast. Shatter its front\nlegs and stop the giant from moving around.
Black <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> is officially classified as a\n<c(3)>corrosive Hannibal<c(0)> species. We have yet to find\nany of its weaknesses. The only suggestion we can\nmake is to take armor that blocks heat. Good luck.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Sariel<c(0)> and a <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)> have taken over\nAegis. Their dance-like movements and strong \nattacks can be stunning but don't let them \nconfuse you. Drag them down to the ground and \nsmash their heads.\n
Challenge Mission:\nWe've received reports of an outbreak of Cocoon\nMaidens in the Factory Ruins. They seem to have\nevolved an immunity to gun attacks, so you'll \nhave to hunt each one down with your sword.
Challenge Mission:\nThe return of <c(3)>Arda Nova<c(0)>, what we all feared, has\ncome true. Two scouts on Aegis have already \nfallen victim. Gather a team and destroy it \nimmediately.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>fallen Borg Camlann<c(0)>. Did you\nknow, the mats you can get off these guys can \nsell for real high? Come equipped in Spark gear,\nalright? Let's go, we're headed to the Carrier\nVessel.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>fallen Zygote<c(0)> and a charged <c(3)>Vajratail<c(0)>. Damn,\nit's just trash... Hey, you. Come along. It's got\nnothing to do with the <c(3)>Amaterasu<c(0)> nearby! I'm just\noffering to split the prize with you.
Challenge Mission:\nShooting down a flying Aragami is pretty hard, \nbut it feels so good. There's a <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> and its \nfallen species, plus a <c(3)>fallen Sariel<c(0)> in the \nFactory Ruins. So? Wanna come with me?
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Susano'o<c(0)> has been sited again. I'm not really \nup for it, but it's my job. It's in the Old City.\nThere's a polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> with it so but it's kinda \nhard for me to do alone. Please help!
Challenge Mission:\nSorry to bug you. Um... Can you come with me for\nmy gun training session? The target is a <c(3)>Quadriga<c(0)>\nand a <c(3)>Tezcatlipoca<c(0)>. I thought I'd practice on big\nenemies first. And, thank you, in advance!
Challenge Mission:\nThe Aragami in the Old City have all disappeared.\nWe sent in scouts and found a <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> and\n<c(3)>corrosive Hannibal<c(0)> there. Eliminate this threat\nimmediately.
Challenge Mission:\nI heard <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)>'s popped up again. He's gotten \nus good a few times now, so I need to get \nrevenge! There's a <c(3)>fallen Chi-You<c(0)> in the area, \nbut if we team up, they're no match for us!
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>fallen Kongou<c(0)>, <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, and\n<c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> are headed here. Avert them at the\nCarrier. Team up with the Second Squad and \ndefend.
Challenge Mission:\nThe Factory Ruins are covered in thicker fog,\ncaused by the melting of <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)>'s ice by\n<c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)>'s heat. The visibility is bad. Go fully\ngeared.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Prithvi Mata<c(0)> with a polar <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>Gboro-<c(0)>\n<c(3)>Gboro<c(0)> servants have descended on the Temple \nRuins. Use Blaze weapons to hammer away at her \nfrozen defenses.
Challenge Mission:\nThe <c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>, and <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> are\nsome Aragami that adapted to the magma when the\nearth erupted. Now, they have gathered in the\nSubways. Go now and extinguish this threat.
Challenge Mission:\nThe last contact we had with our squad \ninvestigating Aegis was that they saw Aragami. \nIt is believed to be a <c(3)>Tsukuyomi<c(0)> and a <c(3)>fallen <c(0)>\n<c(3)>Sariel<c(0)>. Secure Aegis so that we can deploy a \nsearch team.
Challenge Mission:\nOur communication equipment seems to malfunction\nin the Grasslands. A charged <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)>, Fierce\n<c(3)>Kongou<c(0)> and <c(3)>Vajra<c(0)> have been sighted there. They \nmay not be the actual cause, but get rid of them.
Challenge Mission:\nA herd of <c(3)>Kongous<c(0)> have been detected at the\nTemple Ruins again. A <c(3)>Kongou<c(0)>, <c(3)>Fallen Kongou<c(0)> and 2\n<c(3)>Fierce Kongous<c(0)> are wreaking havoc as if\nrepresenting the anger of the abandoned statues.
Challenge Mission:\nSuddenly, a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> appeared on Aegis and \ndestroyed our defense force. Head to Aegis and\neliminate it now. It's an emergency and we\ncannot secure more staff. Give your full \nattention to this mission.
Challenge Mission:\nA <c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> and <c(3)>corrosive Hannibal<c(0)> seem to have\nwiped out the Aragami on Aegis. The two have\ndevoured everything. They are strong, and much \ntoo dangerous to be left alive. We need them \ndefeated, now.
Challenge Mission:\nDefeat the <c(3)>Chi-You<c(0)> in the Grasslands. This area \nhas become dangerous due to the two fallen\n<c(3)>Chi-Yous<c(0)> and two <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)> that are flying rampant.\nBeware of air strikes that can come from\nanywhere.
Challenge Mission:\nFour Aragami have been detected in the Chemical\nFactory Ruins. We believe them to be Cocoon\nMaidens and <c(3)>fallen Ogretails<c(0)>. Don't underestimate\nthem. Keep an eye out above and behind you.
Challenge Mission:\nThere was a plan to shut down Aegis before it\nbecame an Aragami nest, but a <c(3)>fallen Kongou<c(0)>,\n<c(3)>fallen Gboro-Gboro<c(0)>, <c(3)>Fierce Kongou<c(0)> and a <c(3)>Sekhmet<c(0)>\nhave been detected. Eliminate them now.
Challenge Mission:\nAn <c(3)>Aether<c(0)> and <c(3)>Borg Camlann<c(0)> have appeared at the\nTemple Ruins. This has caused a <c(3)>Cocoon Maiden<c(0)>\ninfestation. Fighting in their range can be\ndangerous. Pay attention.
Challenge Mission:\nA battle between a <c(3)>Dyaus Pita<c(0)> and a corrosive\n<c(3)>Hannibal<c(0)> has been sighted on Aegis. We cannot\nignore the havoc being wreaked. Make sure to\nsupress them before Aegis is destroyed.
